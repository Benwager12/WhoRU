The Lookalike Discord Bot :sparkles:

This bot makes use of a private script that I made that makes use of facial recognition with quite a large dataset to recognise a face you give it and compare it to a celebrity's.

## The Prefix
The prefix for this bot is ``w?``

## Why this bot?
This is actually the very first discord bot in python that I have ever made (The rest are in Discord.js), the script is in python so I thought it may be best to use Discord.py for the very first time.

## !!
If you have any inquiries, feel free to message me here on GitHub, however the facial recognition part of the bot is not a hard script but I'll let you figure that out, if you look around, you should be able to do it.
