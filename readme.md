The Lookalike Discord Bot :sparkles:

This bot makes use of a private script that I made that makes use of facial recognition with quite a large dataset to recognise a face you give it and compare it to a celebrity's.

As I have not included the recognise_face part of the bot and it is not public, you may have to create that yourself or use this bot, this bot simply calls that, what is shown here may just be shown as a template.

## The Prefix
The prefix for this bot is ``w?``

## Why this bot?
This is actually the very first discord bot in python that I have ever made (The rest are in Discord.js), the script is in python so I thought it may be best to use Discord.py for the very first time.

## Commands
It should probably be specified that the only command that is implemented at the current time is who, which takes in an attached image (or multiple).

## !!
If you have any inquiries, feel free to message me here on GitHub, however the facial recognition part of the bot is not a hard script but I'll let you figure that out, if you look around, you should be able to do it.
